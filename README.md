# Rediff

A minimal text editor using [GPUI](https://www.gpui.rs/) that shows real-time diffs while you type.

Built for learning editor internals: text buffers, diffs (Myers), ropes, syntax highlighting, etc.

> [!WARNING]
> Rediff is in a early stage of development, expect frequent breaking changes and incomplete features.
